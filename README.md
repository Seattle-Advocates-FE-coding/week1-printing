# week1-printing

To test your knowledge, we've devised a little test for you.

There are two files in this repository. One called buggy-printing.java and another called spaceship.java

In buggy-printing.java, correct all the mistakes in the code and run the code without any failure, CHANGING ANY VALUES WILL RESULT IN A FAILURE

The other file is a cool printing problem. Use what you know of java to make a spaceship out of ASCII text.
